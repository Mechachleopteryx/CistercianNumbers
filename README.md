# Cistercian Number Generator / Convertor

This project is related to the recent video of [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p55Qgt7Ciw) about the cryptic and mysterious numerical system of some secret cistercian monks. I was quite interested by this concept, and by the high compression of writing because each symbol can represent a number between 0 and 9999. So I did a simple converter decimal/Cistercian in order to generate a SVG of the cisterian symbols for any reason.

Here is the related video:
