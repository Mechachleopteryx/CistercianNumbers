# Cistercian Number Generator / Converter

This project is related to the recent video by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p55Qgt7Ciw) about the cryptic and mysterious numerical system of some secret cistercian monks. I was quite interested by this concept, and by the high compression of writing because each symbol can represent a number between 0 and 9999. So I did a simple converter decimal/Cistercian in order to generate a SVG of the cisterian symbols for any reason.

Cistercian Numerals are a 10,000 based number system, and so in order to display large numbers correctly, leading zeros should be added so that the total number of digits is divisible by four.

For example, 123,456,789 in decimal would be input as 000123456789.
